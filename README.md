CropPlanning
=======

CropPlanning is free, open source software to help small farmers plan and manage their production.  For downloads and more info, visit [https://code.google.com/p/cropplanning/](https://code.google.com/p/cropplanning/).

To download the code yourself simply

    git clone https://github.com/claytonrcarter/cropplanning.git

or of course fork it into your own github account.

You will need:

*  Netbeans and Java 1.5
*  A bundle of libraries
    * [Download libraries](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cropplanning/files/Developer%20Files/devel-libs.zip/download)
    
If you unzip the library bundle in the parent folder of the cloned `cropplanning` repo, NetBeans should find all of the libraries automatically.
