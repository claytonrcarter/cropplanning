#summary Steps to follow when preparing a release.
#labels Phase-Deploy,Target-Developers

  # Determine SVN revision number to release and then "tag" that revision as the release name: 
{{{
svn cp -m <commit message> -r <rev> <repos>/<module>/trunk <repos>/<module>/tags/<tag name>
}}} 
Omit the `-r <rev>` if tagging HEAD
  #2 "Switch to" the tag in Netbeans, clean and build.
  # Package files in local CropPlanning/trunk/dist:
    * _Mac_: use Jar Bundler to create an App Bundle containing the main class jar and all dependency jars.
    * _Windows_: use Lauch4J to create a jar launcher (not a wrapper) the will reside next to the main .jar and includes the ./lib dir in its classpath.
  # Create folder structures for distributed archives:
    * create folder: `CropPlanning`
    * _All Platforms_: include:
      * license (`gpl-3.0.txt`)
      * release notes (see ReleaseNotesTemplate)
    * _Mac_: copy app bundle into `CropPlanning` folder
    * _Windows_: copy exe, main jar and lib directory into `CropPlanning` folder
  # Create archives such that the user will open the archive and see:
    * _Mac_: the application and other files.  Use Disk Utility to create a disk image from the `CropPlanning` folder 
    * _Windows_:  a folder `CropPlanning`, which contains the application, jars and other files.  Right click on `CropPlanning` folder and select "7-Zip > Add to archive..."
