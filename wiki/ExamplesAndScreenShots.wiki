== Examples of Printable Seeding Lists ==

The program can generate PDF files on demand.  These files can serve as printable "TODO lists" and can cover a number of predefined time ranges (this week, next week, this and next week ) or you can define a custom time range to print.  Below are examples of the two types of output currently supported.  These lists are generated dynamically from your crop plan and all you have to do is 1) make sure your plan is "correct", 2) press the "export _blah blah blah_ list" button.

==== GH Seeding List ====

The GH seeding list displays only the transplanted crops that are *scheduled to be seeded in the greenhouse* during the time frame you selected.  This example was generated from part of my personal crop plan for 2008 and, you can see at the top, it covers the entire month of March.  

The columns displayed are: Scheduled date of seeding, crop name, variety name, actual plants needed, plants to start (actual needed + a fudge factor), flat size, and number of flats needed.  You can also see that not all of the data fields need to be filled in.

==== Field Planting and Transplanting List ====

The Field Planting and Transplanting list shows two things: page one shows only those plantings *scheduled for direct seeding* and page two shows only plantings that have already been seeded in the GH and are now *scheduled to be set out in the field*.  This example was also generated from my crop plan for 2008 and shows all scheduled field plantings for May.  

Columns displayed on *page 1*: scheduled planting date, crop and variety names, location (field/garden name, bed number, etc; I only have one field so I've left it blank), number of beds to plant, rows per bed, row feet to plant, planter to use (eg, "Planet Jr") and the setting to use on the planter (eg, "Plate 2, hole 19").

*Page 2*: scheduled field transplant date, date this crop was seeded in the GH, ... similar columns from page one, except the last: in row, or between plant, spacing.

= In-Program Examples (Screenshots) =

==== Crop Plan ====

This first screenshot shows the program displaying a crop plan.  One planting from that plan has been selected and is being displayed in detail in the bottom pane.

The colored boxes signify that the value displayed therein is *linked to the list of crops in the "CropDB"* (blue) or *automatically calculated from other entered or linked values* (green).

==== Simple Filter ====

This screenshot shows the same plan as the previous image, except that the program has been set to only display *direct seeded* plantings.  Note how the text underneath the planting list has changed to reflect that contents of the list has changed.  It's telling me that 66 of the 131 plantings I have scheduled are direct seeded and that they comprise 22 beds out of a total of 51.

==== Text Filter ====

Similar to the last image, this time the program has been set to display only *transplanted entries*, but I have entered some text ("*fenn may*") into the "filter field".  The program is, therefore, only displaying *transplanted* entries that match "*fenn*" (no need to type ALL of "fennel") and have a planting, transplanting or harvest date in *may*.

==== Text Filter and Multiple Selected Entries ====

This is a view of the list or database of crops.  Information entered here will show up in the crop plans without you having to reenter it.  The list of crops in this image has been limited to only "*brassica* s" and I have selected three of them in the list.  In the details sections at the bottom, the program is displaying *only the info which these selected entries have in common*.  The rest is still there, but it's hidden.  This let's you perform "batch edits": you can make changes to any field here, and they will be saved to all of the selected crops and varieties.  (_So be careful!_)
