= Plea =

As a _free and open source_ project, we depend upon the your help to keep this going and make it better.  Without funding, development will halt.  Period.  Please help out!

= Make Donations =

We accept donations through [http://www.paypal.com PayPal], which allows you to donate with a credit or debit card if you don't have a PayPal account, or right from your bank account if you do.

If you use the links below, you will be taken to the PayPal website where you will be able to send a donation directly to me (Clayton Carter, lead developer of the Crop Planning Software project) via the email address `crcarter@alumni.indiana.edu`.  Aside from the small processing fee charged to us by PayPal (approx. 6% for $10 donations, ~4% for $25, and ~3% for $100), all of your money will go to fund work on this software: developing new features, fixing bugs, creating documentation and such.
