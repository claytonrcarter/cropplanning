= Issues =

There are three primary issue _tags_ which can help us to juggle all of the issues:

 * Version
 * Milestone
 * Priority

=== Version ===

All issues *must have* a _Version_ label.  If a specific targeted version cannot be decided upon, then it should be labeled as _Future_.

=== Milestone ===

_Milestone_ helps to qualify where in the release cycle each issue fits: Alpha, Beta or RC (Release Candidate)

_Milestone_ should only be specified if _Version_ is given as a specific number or release (ie 1.0, 1.5, etc.).  If _Version_ is specified as _Future_, then _Milestone_ *should be left blank* or unspecified.

=== Priority ===

_Priority_ helps us judge how important an issue is.  It may be left unspecified if the _Version_ is _Future_.  Otherwise, the priorities are:

 * Blocking: of vital importance; the release cannot proceed w/o it; in an old release, the bug must be fixed immediately
 * Wanted: normal priority; highly desirable fixes/features, but a release can proceed w/o a fix
 * WouldBeNice: lowest priority; it would be great if we could handle these issues for the targeted release, but we can't make any guarantees
