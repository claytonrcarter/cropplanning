= Process for ALL new Columns =

== Step 1: PLAN ==

Plan, plan, plan.  Make sure that this data/column/property is really needed.

== Step 2: Update Schema ==

This will make sure that new tables/installations will be correct.

== Step 3: Create Update Method ==

This is in HSQLUpdate and will make sure that existing databases will be up to date.  Generally, the most common actions will be:

ALTER table ADD COLUMN new_col
ALTER table ALTER COLUMN col RENAME TO new_col

Often, you'll have to cycle over all of the crop plan tables and update each in turn.

== Step 4: Add property number(s) ==

This is in CPSDataModelConstants.

== Step 5: Add column(s) to HSQLColumnMap ==

After this, the new columns should show up in the list view and be fully viwable/editable.  If the data needs to be part of the CPSCrop/Planting data structures or needs to be displayed as part of the detail or info panels, keep going.  Otherwise, you're done.

= Process for Columns which need to be part of the CPSCrop/CPSPlanting data structures =

== Step 6: Add getters and setters to CPSCrop/Planting ==

== Step 7: Update methods resultSetAsCrop/Planting ==

This is HSQLDB.
